# 📘 Day 02 Lecture Practices

## 💻 Pass by Reference Coding Practice

### 🧩 Part B-1.1: Add a method *declaration*
1. Open `Day2.h`
2. Add a declaration for a method called GetLights to the Day2.h file
   - It should not return anything.
   - It should have 1 vector parameter that is passed by reference.

### 🧩 Part B-1.2: Add a method *definition*

1. Open the `Day2.cpp` file
2. Add the GetLights definition to the Day2.cpp file
   - fill the vector with Target objects.
	- hint: use nested for loops. each loop should loop 48 times.
	  - the outer loop is for the rows
	  - the inner loop is for the columns
	  - create a Target object inside of the inner loop
		- randomize the color of each target object (use rand() % 255)
		- be sure to use the for loop variables to initialize the row and col of the target

### 🧩 Part B-1.3: call the method
1. Open the `Day2.cpp` file
2. In the PartB_1() method, call the GetLights method passing the “lights” variable to it.

## 💻 Const Parameters Coding Practice

### 🧩 Part B-2.1: create a *declaration*
1. Open `Day2.h`
2. Add a method declaration for a method called DrawLights.
   - It should not return anything.
   - It should have 2 parameters: a vector of Targets parameter and a Map parameter.

### 🧩 Part B-2.2: create a *definition*
1. Open `Day2.cpp`
2. Add a method definition for DrawLights.
   - In the method definition, call DrawCell for each Target. (see PartB_1() for an example).

### 🧩 Part B-2.3: call the method
1. Open `Day2.cpp`.
2. In the PartB_2() method, call the DrawLights method after the call to engine.ClearScreen.


> NOTE: you’ll need to call your GetLights method in the correct place (look for the comments in the code where you should call it  in the PartB_2() method)

## 💻 Const Methods Coding Practice
1. Open the `Player.h` and `Player.cpp` files.
3. Evaluate the methods and add const to the ones that do not modify the fields of the Player.

## 💻 Erasing in a Loop Coding Practice

### 🧩 Part B-3.1: create a declaration
1. Open `Day2.h`
2. Add a method declaration for a method called EraseLights.
   - It should not return anything.
   - It should have 1 parameters vector of Targets parameter
   
### 🧩 Part B-3.2: create a definition
1. Open `Day2.cpp`
2. Add a method definition for EraseLights.
   - Inside the method, erase any light from the vector whose red value is less than 100.

### 🧩 Part B-3.3: call a method
1. Open `Day2.cpp`
2. Call your EraseLights after the call to GetLights.

> NOTE: you’ll need to call your GetLights method and DrawLights method in the correct places (look for the comments in the code where you should call them in the PartB_3() method)
